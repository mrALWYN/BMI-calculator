## Overview:

This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The BMI calculator allows users to input their weight in kilograms and height in centimeters, and it calculates their BMI based on these inputs. The BMI result is then categorized into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese, providing users with insights into their body composition.

## Project Structure:

### HTML:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the BMI calculator interface. It includes input fields for weight and height, a button to trigger the BMI calculation, and a results section to display the calculated BMI along with corresponding health categories.

### CSS:
- **stylesheet.css**: Defines the styling for the BMI calculator interface. It includes styles for the overall body, panel, input fields, buttons, and the BMI result box. The background features a gradient color scheme for an aesthetically pleasing design.

### JavaScript:
- **main.js**: Manages the BMI calculation logic. It retrieves input values, performs the BMI calculation, and categorizes the result into different health categories. The script also handles error messages for invalid inputs, negative values, or missing data.

## How to Use:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters.
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to view your BMI result and corresponding health category.

## Additional Information:

- The project includes a BMI Index table below the calculator, providing a quick reference for interpreting BMI results.
- Styling is achieved through CSS, enhancing the user interface with a responsive and visually appealing design.
- The JavaScript file, `main.js`, contains the BMI calculation logic and handles error scenarios, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.

Feel free to customize the project, adding features or modifying styles to suit specific requirements. This BMI calculator serves as a practical and accessible tool for individuals interested in monitoring their body mass index.
